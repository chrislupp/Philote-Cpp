# Philote-Cpp

***Author**: Christopher A. Lupp*

Philote MDO is a standard currently being defined by a working group sponsored
by the AIAA Multidisciplinary Design Optimization Technical Committee. While the
Philote standard defines how disciplines are defined and how data is
transmitted, the standard does not encompass language interfaces. This library
is an implementation of C++ bindings for the Philote standard.

## Premise

Philote disciplines rely on transmitting data and calling functions (remote 
procedure calls) via the network. This does not necessarily mean that the 
disciplines must run on a separate computer (calling via localhost is a 
common use case). Disciplines can be defined as explicit (think, f(x) = x) 
or as implicit (defining a residual, e.g., R(x) = f(x) - x, which must be 
solved). The disciplines must provide a function evaluation and optionally 
may provide gradients (for gradient-based optimization).


## Building Philote-Cpp

### Dependencies

To build Philote-Cpp you must have
[gRPC](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/cpp/quickstart/) 
and [protobuf](https://protobuf.dev) 
installed (building gRPC should also install protobuf). This library uses 
the C++-20 standard, so you must use a compliant compiler. Finally, CMake is 
used to configure and build the code.

### Build Process

To configure the build process, create a build directory and run CMake:

    cmake <path to the source directory> <additional options>

You do not need to provide additional options, however in some cases they 
can be used to customize the build (for example set the build type to 
Release or Debug with -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release). Next, the build is 
started (here, using make, as it is the default build method for Unix[-like] 
systems):

    make -j 8

In this instance the build will compile with 8 workers, due to the -j flag.


## Platform Support

Philote-Cpp is tested against the following platforms and compilers:

    - Ubuntu 22.04
        - gRPC 1.51.1 using:
            - gcc-9/g++-9
            - gcc-10/g++-10
            - gcc-11/g++-11
            - gcc-12/g++-12
            - clang-13/clang++-13
            - clang-14/clang++-14

While early tests were written to run on all three major operating system
(Linux, Windows, and macOS), the GitHub billing for the non-Linux OS's is so
high (macOS is billed at a factor of ten higher than Linux) that it is not
feasible to run anything other than Linux. However, as the main dependency for
Philote-Cpp is gRPC, it is likely that any system that can compile and run gRPC
will be able to run Philote-Cpp. This is especially true, as Philote-Cpp adheres
to the same C++ standards as gRPC.
